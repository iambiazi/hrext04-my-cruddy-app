Prioritize Educational Tasks over 'cool features'


Basic plan
  learn vue and implement it
        going to spend the rest of today learning and implementing some Vue
        Heard that it's not included in the immersive
        Looking to learn new things. Feel like there's a lot of overlap from the things I did on twittler
        Vue seems fairly intuitive.
  Implement a...just get 3 things done or something.
        problem with to do lists, too much choice, people stop using them, forget to check things off, etc
        priority
  to do list/calendar hybrid
  share item through social ways - for sake of learning? (find this feature annoying)
    way for other users to share they completed a task
        maybe some message...so and so just did x, what have you accompolished today?
  send notification to phone somehow?
  put an estimated time to complete
    allow user a way to plan out tasks based on these time estimates
        Golden rule in planning: don’t schedule more than 75% of your time.




Blocked off and deleted items based on importance

Higher priority
  add due date
  format the display of the items in a list (need to add more detail)
  color coded priority/categories
  highlight certain items/star
  mouse over to see details
    time stamps (moment.js)
    ability to add/leave comments on item
  ability to select and delete multiple items (checkbox?)
  quick add - if i do browser extension
  frequent reminders pool


Bonus features, medium priority
  drag and drop to arrange
  search/filter on keyup/keydown
  auto-complete when searching/filtering
  reminders? (push operation?)
  delete item confirmation


Low priority
  show deleted items and allow for undelete
  pagination (if more than 10 show a next button)
  category pages (not really pages, just a show/hide trick)
  strike-through completed/deleted items (styling)
  add more items button, that shows another input section allowing for multiple items to be added at once



      options page (ability to set/toggle options)



     upload files/images
